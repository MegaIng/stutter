# stutter
A prototype implementation of [stutter](https://github.com/stutter-lang/stutter) by reddit user u/cookiengineer

This is the result of my understanding of the stutter docs and the discussion in the [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/a0ef9y/searching_for_inspiration_are_there_any/) between me and @cookiengineer.

**It does not execute yet.** It currently only translates from stutter to python and prints the python code. The python code is syntaticle correct, but the runtime is missing.
